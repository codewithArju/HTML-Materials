        The <b>Bengal tiger </b>is a population of the Panthera tigris tigris,
        subspecies and the nominate tiger
        subspecies. It
        ranks among the largest wild cats alive today.
        It is estimated to have been present in the Indian subcontinent since the Late Pleistocene.
        for about 12,000 to
        16,500 years.
        Its historical range covered the
        Indus River valley until the early 19th century,
        almost all of India, western Pakistan, southern Nepal, Bangladesh,
        Bhutan and southwestern China. Today, it inhabits India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and
        southwestern China. It is threatened by poaching, habitat loss and habitat fragmentation.
        As of 2022, the Bengal tiger population was estimated at 3,167–3,682 individuals in India,
        316–355 individuals
        in Nepal, 131
        individuals in Bhutan and around
        114 individuals in Bangladesh
